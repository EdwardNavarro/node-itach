node-itach
==========

A simple node module to connect to global cache itach devices to send ir or rf remote signals.

Just made this quickly to control the lighting and tv in my apartment - it's a small part of my home-remote application.

It works very well but only has basic functionality right now (sending ir, receiving response and reconnecting if connection lost). Which is enough for my use case but I might improme on this in the future to make it a more complete module.


I'm testing with an IP2IR device.
